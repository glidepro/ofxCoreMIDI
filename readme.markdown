ofxCoreMIDI
===================================

DESCRIPTION
-----------

ofxCoreMIDI is the beginnings of an example project that allows the PGMidi class written for Objective C to be used with relative ease with [OpenFrameworks](http://www.openframeworks.cc/).  Currently the example only caters for MIDI-out but it's a start!


BUILD REQUIREMENTS
------------------

This example project has been tested in openFrameworks 0062 iPhone build.

Download the example project and place it in your /apps directory.  As well as openFrameworks, you will need to add the Source directory from PGMidi to your /src directory so that it looks like /src/Source.  You can download that from [here](http://gitorious.org/midimonitor/midimonitor/trees/master).
